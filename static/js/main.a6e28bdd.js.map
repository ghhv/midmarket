Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,\n * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value\n * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence\n * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n * with `_#value`.\n *\n * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n * enabled using `_.chain`.\n *\n * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n *\n * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut\n * fusion is subject to change.\n *\n * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n * directly or indirectly
